## About the Guide

This guide started as an Institute-internal wiki, focused on providing guidance and best practices for collaborative and interdisciplinary (computer science + biology) work. Recognizing that the topics and suggestions are broadly applicable to anyone working in similar or adjacent fields, we moved the vast majority to this [guide](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/). To increase accessibility for those less familiar with GitHub, we generated the [web site](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/) from our Markdown documents (which used to be wiki pages) with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Imageomics/Imageomics-guide/issues) with any questions regarding the content fo this guide or if you would like to contribute to the [Glossary](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/wiki-guide/Glossary-for-Imageomics/) or [Helpful Tools page](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/wiki-guide/Helpful-Tools-for-your-Workflow/).
