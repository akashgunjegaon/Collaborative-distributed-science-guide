# Welcome to the Imageomics Institute!

This wiki is intended to host internal documentation, making the information needed to get started with and use institute resources readily available to all members. It will evolve continuously with the institute.

## Highlights
There are many pages of useful information contained in this wiki covering a range of topics from institute hardware, to repositories and archives, to a glossary of _imageomics-related_ terms.

### Just starting a project?
Check out our guides to get your project off on the right foot!
