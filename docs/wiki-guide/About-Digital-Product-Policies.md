# Imageomics Digital Product Policies

This section contains the Imageomics digital policy documents. The Digital Products Release and Licensing Policy sets expectations for the publication of all digital products (e.g., data, models, code). The Digital Product Life Cycle is a project life cycle guide intended to clarify the best practices&mdash;described throughout this guide&mdash;that will aid in compliance with the Digital Products Release and Licensing Policy. It is also generally a good reference for project planning.

We encourage users of this template guide to adapt these policies as needed for their organization or group.
