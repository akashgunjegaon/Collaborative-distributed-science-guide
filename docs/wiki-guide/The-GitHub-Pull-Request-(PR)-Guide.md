# **GitHub Pull Request (PR) Guide Overview**

This guide is divided into three essential sections to help you effectively manage pull requests in a collaborative project:

- [Creating a Pull Request](#1-create-a-pull-request): This section explains how to properly prepare and submit a pull request (PR) to ensure that your changes are well-documented, easy to review, and aligned with project goals.
- [Reviewing a Pull Request](#2-review-a-pull-request): Learn the best practices for providing constructive feedback, identifying potential issues, and ensuring code quality during the review process.
- [Responding to a Pull Request Review](#3-respond-to-a-pull-request-review): Understand how to address reviewer feedback, make necessary changes, and ensure your pull request meets the required standards for approval.

By following these steps, you will contribute to a smooth and efficient workflow, ensuring collaboration and quality in your project.

- Select Comment: Provide general feedback on the changes without explicitly approving or rejecting them.
- Select Approve: Indicate that you’ve reviewed the changes and approve them for merging. A common comment for simple approvals is "LGTM" (Looks Good to Me).
- Select Request changes: Provide feedback indicating that revisions are needed before the changes can be approved.

Current review round is done; this publishes your comments and suggestions. Then the PR can either be merged or updated (depending on approval or comments). We generally expect that whoever submits the PR will merge once all feedback has been incorporated or otherwise addressed.

### 3.2 Incorporate Feedback Changes

After receiving feedback on your pull request, you can apply the changes in one of two ways: either by committing each change individually or by grouping several changes into a single commit. The method you choose depends on whether you prefer fine-grained control over the commit history or a more streamlined approach.

#### 3.2.1 Apply a change in its own commit
If you agree with at suggested change, qpply it by creating a separate commit for it. This approach helps keep your commit history clear and each change traceable.

/// caption

#### 3.2.2 Add multiple suggestions to a batch of changes
If you plan to include multiple changes in one commit, you can add suggestions to a batch. Once you've collected all the desired suggestions, click "Commit suggestions" to apply them in one go.

![Add suggested change to batch button](images/GH-PR-guide/369920952-1b4e0db0-3451-448b-822f-dd1b14679ec6.png){ loading=lazy, width="600" }

### 3.3 Add Commit Message
In the commit message field, enter a brief, descriptive message that clearly explains the changes made to the file(s).

### 3.4 Click Commit changes
After entering your commit message, click the "Commit changes" button to finalize and save your modifications to the repository. This step ensures that your changes are recorded and can be reviewed or merged into the main codebase.

### 3.5 Re-requesting a Review
If you’ve addressed all the requested changes and your pull request requires further review, re-request a review by notifying the reviewers. This action prompts them to evaluate your updated code and provide feedback or approval.

### 3.6 Out-of-scope Suggestion
If the suggested change falls outside the scope of your pull request, create a new issue to address the feedback separately. Issues can be created directly from a PR comment.
