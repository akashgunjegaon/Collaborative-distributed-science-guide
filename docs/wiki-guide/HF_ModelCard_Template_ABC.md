NOTE: Add more tags (your particular animal, type of model and use-case, etc.).

As with your GitHub Project repo, it is important to choose an appropriate license for your model. Alongside the appropriate stakeholders (eg., your PI, co-authors), select a license that is [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) (OSI) compliant. You may also wish to consider adding a [RAIL license](https://www.licenses.ai/ai-licenses), which addresses responsible use.
For more information on how to choose a license and why it matters, see [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com) and [A Quick Guide to Software Licensing for the Scientist-Programmer](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002598) by A. Morin, et al.
See the [ABC Global Center policy for licensing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SlITG-r7kdJB6C8f4FCJ9Z7o7ccwldZoSRJKjhRAWVA/edit#heading=h.c1sxg0wsiqru) for more information.

License tags (for the `yaml` above) can be found [here](https://hf.co/docs/hub/repositories-licenses).

See more options for the above information by clicking "edit model card" on your repo.

Fill in as much information as you can at each location that says "More information needed".

# Model Card for [Model Name]

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. 

This model card aims to be a base template for new models. It has been generated using [this raw template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md?plain=1), and further altered to suit ABC Global Center needs. -->

## Model Details
